    <p>A. THE RECODING PROBLEM IN DATA FUSION</p>
<p>Assuming that \(Y\) and \(Z\) are two variables that summarize a same latent information in two separate (no overlapping rows) databases A and B respectively,
so that \(Y\) and \(Z\) are never jointly observed in A and B. Assuming also that A and B share a subset of common covariates X of any types (with same encodings in A and B)
completed or not. Integrating these two databases often requires to solve the recoding problem observed between \(Y\) and \(Z\) by creating an unique database where
the missing information of \(Y\) and/or \(Z\) is fully completed.</p>

<p>B. INFORMATIONS ABOUT THE ALGORITHM</p>
<p>As with the function <code>OT_outcome</code>, the function <code>OT_joint</code> provides a solution to the recoding problem by proposing an
application of optimal transportation which aims is to search for a bijective mapping between the joint distributions of \((Y,X)\) and \((Z,X)\) in A and B (see (2) for more details).
The principle of the algorithm is also based on the resolution of an optimization problem, which provides a \(\gamma\) solution (as called in (1) and (2)) which is an estimation
of the joint distribution of \((X,Y,Z)\) according to the database to complete (see the argument <code>which.DB</code> for the choice of the database). While the models <code>OUTCOME</code> and <code>R_OUTCOME</code> integrated in
the function <code>OT_outcome</code> require post-treatment steps to provide individual predictions, the algorithm <code>JOINT</code> direcly uses estimations of the conditional distributions \((Y|Z,X)\) in B and
\((Z|Y,X)\) in A to predict the corresponding incomplete individuals informations of \(Y\) and/or \(Z\) respectively.
This algorithm supposes that the conditional distribution \((Y|X)\) must be identical in A and B. Respectively, \((Z|X)\) is supposed identical in A and B.
Estimations a posteriori of conditional probabilities \(P[Y|X,Z]\) and \(P[Z|X,Y]\) are available by profiles of covariates in output (See the objects <code>estimatorYB</code> and <code>estimatorZA</code>).
Estimations of \(\gamma\) are also available according to the chosen transport distributions (See the arguments \(\gamma_A\) and \(\gamma_B\)).</p>
<p>The model <code>R-JOINT</code> gathers enrichments of the model <code>JOINT</code> and is also available via the function <code>OT_joint</code> It allows users to add a relaxation term in the algorithm to relax distributional assumptions (<code>maxrelax</code>&gt;0),
and (or) add also a positive regularization term (<code>lamdba.reg</code>&gt;0) expressing that the transportation map does not vary to quickly with respect of covariates \(X\).
Is is suggested to users to calibrate these two parameters a posteriori by studying the stability of the individual predictions in output.</p>

<p>C. TYPE OF REQUIRED INPUT DATABASE</p>
<p>The input database is a data.frame that must be saved in a specific form by users:</p><ul>
<li><p>Two overlayed databases containing a common column of databases' identifiers (A and B, 1 or 2, by examples, encoded in numeric or factor form)</p></li>
<li><p>A column corresponding to the target variable with its specific encoding in A (For example a factor \(Y\) encoded in \(n_Y\) levels, ordered or not, with NAs in the corresponding rows of B)</p></li>
<li><p>A column corresponding to another target outcome summarizing the same latent information with its specific endoded in B (By example a factor \(Z\) in \(n_Z\) levels, with NAs in rows of A)</p></li>
<li><p>The order of the variables in the database have no importance but the indexes of the columns related to the 3rd columns previously described (ie ID, \(Y\) and \(Z\)) must be rigorously specified
in the argument <code>index_DB_Y_Z</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A set of shared common categorical covariates (at least one but more is recommended) complete or not (provided that the number of covariates exceeds 1) is required. On the contrary to the
function <code>OT_outcome</code>, please notice, that the function <code>OT_joint</code> does not accept continuous covariates therefore these latters will have to be categorized beforehand or using the provided input process (see <code>quanti</code>).</p></li>
</ul><p>The function <code>merge_dbs</code> is available in this package to assist user in the preparation of their databases, so please, do not hesitate to use it beforehand if necessary.</p>
<p>Remarks about the outcomes:</p><ul>
<li><p>A target outcome can be categorical, in factor, ordered or not, discrete (with a finite number of values ONLY) but, notice that, if they are stored in numeric they will be automatically converted in ordered factors.</p></li>
<li><p>If a target outcome is incomplete, the corresponding rows will be automatically dropped during the execution of the function.</p></li>
</ul><p>The type of each variables (including ID, \(Y\) and \(Z\)) of the database must be rigorously specified, in one of the four arguments <code>quanti</code>, <code>nominal</code>, <code>ordinal</code> and <code>logic</code>.</p>

<p>D. TRANSFORMATIONS OF CONTINUOUS COVARIATES</p>
<p>Continuous covariates with infinite numbers of values will have to be categorized beforehand their inclusions in the function.
To assist users in this task, the function <code>OT_joint</code> integrates in its syntax a process dedicated to the categorization of continuous covariates. For this, it is necessary to rigorously fill in
the arguments <code>quanti</code> and <code>convert.clss</code>.
The first one informs about the indexes in database of the continuous variables to transform in ordered factor while the second one specifies the corresponding number of desired balanced levels (for unbalanced levels, users must do transformations by themselves).
Therefore <code>convert.num</code> and <code>convert.clss</code> must be vectors of same length, but if the length of <code>quanti</code> exceeds 1, while the length of <code>convert.clss</code> is 1, then, by default, all the covariates to convert will have the same number of classes (transformation by quantiles),
that corresponds to the value specified in the argument <code>convert.clss</code>.
Please notice that only covariates can be transformed (not outcomes) and missing informations are not taken into account for the transformations.
Moreover, all the indexes informed in the argument <code>convert.num</code> must also be informed in the argument <code>quanti</code>.
Finally, it is suggested to declare all discrete covariates as ordinal factors using the argument <code>ordinal</code>.</p>

<p>E. INFORMATIONS ABOUT DISTANCE FUNCTIONS AND RELATED PARAMETERS</p>
<p>Each individual (or row) of a given database is here characterized by his covariates, so the distance between 2 individuals or groups of individuals depends on similarities between covariates
according to the distance function chosen by user (via the argument <code>dist.choice</code>). Actually four distance functions are implemented in <code>OT_joint</code> to take into account the most frequently encountered situation (see (3)):</p><ul>
<li><p>the Manhattan distance ("M")</p></li>
<li><p>the Euclidean distance ("E")</p></li>
<li><p>the Gower distance for mixed data (see (4): "G")</p></li>
<li><p>the Hamming distance for binary data ("H")</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let two profiles of covariates \(P_1\) (\(n_1\) individuals) and \(P_2\) (\(n_2\) individuals) will be considered as neighbors if \(dist(P_1,P_2) &lt; prox.X \times max(dist(P_i,P_j))\) where \(prox.X\) must be fixed by user (\(i = 1,\dots,n_1\) and \(j = 1,\dots,n_2\)). This choice is used in the calculation of the <code>JOINT</code> and <code>R_JOINT</code> algorithms.
In the same way, for a given profile of covariates \(Pj\), an individual i will be considered as a neighbor of \(Pj\) if \(dist(i,P_j) &lt; prox.dist \times max(dist(i,P_j))\) where \(prox.dist\) will be fixed by user.</p>
<p>For more details about the related algorithms integrated in <code>OT_joint</code>, please consult (2).</p>
