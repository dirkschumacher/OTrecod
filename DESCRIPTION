Description: In the context of data integration, the package \code{OTrecod} provides a set of original functions dedicated to the solving of recoding problems by using optimal transportation theory (G.Monge, 1781).From two databases with no overlapping part except a subset of shared variables, the functions of the package assist users until the obtention of an unique synthetic database, where the missing information is fully completed.
