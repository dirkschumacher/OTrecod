Description: In the context of data fusion, the package OTrecod provides a set of functions dedicated to recoding problems using optimal transportation theory (G.Monge, 1781). From two databases with no overlapping part except a subset of shared variables, the functions of the package assist users until the obtention of an unique synthetic database, where the missing information is fully completed.
